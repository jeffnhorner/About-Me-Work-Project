      <h2 id="aboutme" class="about-title">About Me</h2>
      <p id="about-me-main-text">I was born and raised in Spring, TX, graduated from Klein Collins High School in 2008, and later graduated from the best University in the state of Texas, <a id="college" href="https://www.tamu.edu" target="_blank">Texas A&M University</a>, in 2012. After graduating from college, I spent 1.5 years in sales (Commercial Insurance) and was bored out of my mind. I received an opportunity in the Woodlands to work as a Financial Analyst at a bank in late 2014 where I spent the last 3.5 years before coming to <a id="geek" href="https://www.topspotims.com" target="_blank">TopSpot Internet Marketing</a>. I applied at TopSpot after teaching myself how to code over 14 months and building a few websites for contract work. Web Development and just technology in general fascinates me more than anything else so I'm excited to be working everyday on things I'm passionate about.</p>

          <p class="about-text">We dance...a lot. This photo really portrays and describes our relationship. Me trying to dance and keep up with her, her laughing at my moves, and me laughing with her because I know I'm terrible at dancing. Life with her has really helped me get out of my comfort zone since I'm an introvert and she is not. At all. </p>
