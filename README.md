This project was completed at work during my first month at my job.

I had to utilize the programming langauges I was familiar with - html, css, and es6 - to create a website that helped my coworkers get to know me. 

This project was during my SEO training with the company so when I was done coding the project, I presented it to the entire SEO team (~40 employees) to let them dissect my code and see if there were any errors from an SEO perspective.
